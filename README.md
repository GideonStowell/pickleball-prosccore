# Pickelball Proscore
 Check out the demo [here](pickleball-proscore.vercel.app)
 
 The purpose of this project was to try out using Next.js and to make a simple webapp to keep track of pickleball scoring. 
 
 The scoring can be adjusted to fit the game size you want to play and mistakes can be undone on the fly.
